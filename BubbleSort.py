# Bubblesort is an algorithm that sorts an array from lowest to highest value
# It reads all the numbers on the array, comparing them to the next value
# If it's lower, then it jumps to the next value, if it's higher it's thrown next to it's highest value or if it's the highest value it's thrown to the end of the array

# Reads the values from the array and sorts them into the algorithm
for i  in range(n-1):
    # This one reads the numbers in the array and throws them in the algorithm
    for j in range(n-i-1):
